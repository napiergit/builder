Each feature should have its own folder
Create a .windsurf/rules in each feature folder and define your interpretation of the requirements
This was we can work on each feature independently of the whole project if necessary

Folder naming convention:
Keep folder names short and human readable.
Don't use multiple words.
All lowercase.
